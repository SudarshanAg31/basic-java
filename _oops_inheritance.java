// Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors
// of its parent object automatically.
// In such a way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors 
// which are defined in other classes. 
// In Java, the class which inherits the members of another class is called derived class 
// and the class whose members are inherited is called base class.
// The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.
